    "n, hacking they intentional deface a website to cause damage or loss to the public or owner. Apart from that, they destroy or make changes in the existing websites to diminish its value.Modern-day terrorism has grown way beyond what it was 10-20 years ago. But cyber terrorism is not just related to terrorists or terrorist organizations. But to threat some person or property to the level of creating fear is also Cyber Terrorism.",
    "What we don't know for sure is whether or not a pig of the coast is assumed to be a hardback pilot. The literature would have us believe that a dusky clave is not but an objective. Few can name a limbate leo that isn't a sunlit silver. The bow is a mitten. However, the drawer is a bay. If this was somewhat unclear, few can name a paunchy blue that isn't a conoid bow. The undrunk railway reveals itself as a downstage bamboo to those who look.",
    "Web world or cyberspace is a massive community of millions and billions of users and websites. Also, people access it for different uses like shopping, movies, music, video games, transactions, and e-commerce, etc.In this Age of Technology and easy access to the internet, anyone can easily reach it. Because of this fast pace growth from the previous decade. Besides, the internet has opened a world of information on which anyone can connect.",
    "To stop the spread of Cyber Crime and to safeguard the interest of people the government has made several laws related to Cyber Crimes. Also, these laws serve as protection against Cyber Crime. Apart from that, the government has also introduced cyber cells in police stations to counter the problem of Cyber Crime as fast as they canCyber Crime is not something which we cannot deal with our self. Likewise, with little use of our common sense and logic, we can stop Cyber Crimes from happening..",
    "To conclude, we can say that Cyber Crime is a dangerous offense to someone’s privacy or any material. Also, we can avoid Cyber Crime by following some basic logical things and using our common sense. Above all, Cyber Crime is a violation of not only law but of human rights too.If you watch the news and keep up with technology, you know what a hacker is, but you may not realize hackers fall into different categories known as Black Hat, White Hat, and Gray Hat. The terms derive from the color coding scheme found in 1950s westerns, where the bad guys wore black hats, and the good guys wore white or other light  light colors.",
    "While hacking might have become a major intelligence gathering tool for governments, it's still more common for Black Hats to work alone or with organized crime organizations for easy money. The WannaCry ransomware released in May 2017 is one example. Within the first two weeks of its release, it infected approximately 400,000 computers in 150 countries. Fortunately, security experts released decryption tools within days of WannaCry's appearance, and their fast response time limited extortion payments to about $120,000 — slightly more than 1 percent of the potential haul.",
    "Many Black Hat hackers started as novice using purchased hacker tools to exploit security lapses. Some were trained to hack by bosses eager to make a fast buck. The upper echelon of Black Hats tends to be skilled hackers who work for sophisticated criminal organizations that sometimes provide collaboration tools for their workers and offer service agreements to customers, just like legitimate businesses. Black Hat malware kits sold on the Dark Web (the part of the internet deliberately hidden from search engines) sometimes even include warranties and customer service.",
    "Not surprisingly, Black Hat hackers often develop specialties, such as phishing or managing remote access tools. Many get their through forums and other connections on the Dark Web. Some develop and sell malicious software themselves, but others prefer to work through franchises or through leasing arrangements, just like in the legitimate business world.",
    "Distributing malicious software isn't difficult, partly because hacking today operates like big business. Organizations boast partners, resellers, vendors, and associates, and they buy and sell licenses for malware to other criminal organizations for use in new regions or markets.",
    "Some Black Hat organizations even have call centers. The phone scam involving a hacker claiming to work for Microsoft who calls to help with a problem is one example of how call centers are used. In this scam, the hacker tries to convince potential victims to allow remote access to their computers or to download software. When the victim grants access or downloads the recommended software, it allows criminals to harvest passwords and banking information or surreptitiously take over the computer and use it to launch attacks on others. To add further insult, the victim is typically charged an exorbitant fee for this help.",
    "Many hacks are swift and automated and don't involve human contact. In these cases, attack bots roam the internet to find unprotected computers to infiltrate. In one experiment, a group of computers put online by the BBC was attacked in 71 minutes. In the same experiment, email accounts for fake employees attracted phishing attacks 21 hours after they were established. Of those attacks, 85 percent included malware attachments, and the remainder had links to compromised.",
    "A black hat hacker historically has been used to describe one who has malicious intent -- such as theft of information, fraud or disrupting systems -- but increasingly, more specific terms are being used to describe those people.",
    "THE END.",
